## 2025-02-18 - Skip Link Rejected
**Learning:** The "Skip to main content" link pattern, while standard for accessibility, was explicitly rejected for this project. This suggests a preference for a strictly "app-like" interface without traditional web navigation aids that might disrupt the visual immersion or map interaction.
**Action:** Do not implement "Skip to main content" links or similar overlay navigation anchors. Focus on semantic HTML and keyboard shortcuts instead.
