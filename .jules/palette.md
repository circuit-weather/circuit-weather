## 2025-02-18 - Skip Link Rejected
**Learning:** The "Skip to main content" link pattern, while standard for accessibility, was explicitly rejected for this project. This suggests a preference for a strictly "app-like" interface without traditional web navigation aids that might disrupt the visual immersion or map interaction.
**Action:** Do not implement "Skip to main content" links or similar overlay navigation anchors. Focus on semantic HTML and keyboard shortcuts instead.

## 2025-02-18 - Share Button Rejected
**Learning:** The user explicitly rejected the addition of a "Share" button to the race info banner. This indicates a preference against cluttering the UI with sharing utilities, possibly because the URL is already easily shareable or the focus should remain strictly on weather/race data.
**Action:** Avoid adding social sharing or URL copying buttons to the interface unless explicitly requested.
